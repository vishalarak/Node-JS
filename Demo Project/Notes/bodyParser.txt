body-parser in Node.js:
# What is body-parser?
                        body-parser is a middleware for Node.js and Express applications that helps parse and extract data from the body of HTTP requests, particularly for handling form data and JSON data.
# Why use body-parser?
                        It simplifies the process of parsing incoming data from HTTP POST requests, making it easier to work with data submitted via forms or sent as JSON in API requests.
# How body-parser works:
                        When you use body-parser, you can access the parsed request body as a JavaScript object, making it easy to process and work with the data.
                        It supports different formats, including JSON and URL-encoded form data.
# Configuring body-parser:
                            To use body-parser, you typically require it in your Node.js/Express application and use it as middleware.
                

# Here's an example of configuring body-parser for handling URL-encoded form data:

const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const app = express();

// Parse URL-encoded form data
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

// Your routes and server setup go here

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
